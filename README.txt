Scratch to Android

This is a sort of Java/Android framework designed to facilitate conversion of MIT's Scratch programs to Java Android SDK programs as a set of cooperating threads. It will evolve into a tutorial directed towards top Scratch programmers that want to advance to programming in Java for Android.

Scratch makes it very natural to program each sprite of a Project as a set of paralell threads without having to worry about thread synchronization. The Java framework is intended to do the same - basically the programmer is told "Put your sprites in the drawable folder, your scripts in the Scripts Class transforming each Scratch instruction into java (say "move 3 steps" to sprite.moveSteps(3)) and voila! You have your scratch program running in Andorid!

That's the start. The tutorial will eventually tell the new programmer how to understand what the framework does, and then encourage him or her to pursue the more advanced stuff...

Collaborators welcome!

Antecedents:

* Google and now MIT have App Inventor - block programming in the PC for Android - but it does not produce the Java Code. So Scratch programmers that migrate to App Inventor are still limited to Inventor's limitations, and still do not learn to code in "real" languages

There is also CATROID, sort of scratch block programming directly in Android screens. Still block programming...
